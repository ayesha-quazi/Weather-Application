# Weather-Application
A simple application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search for a city to view its current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with intuitive visuals. Additionally, entering an incorrect city name will display an error message for user guidance.
